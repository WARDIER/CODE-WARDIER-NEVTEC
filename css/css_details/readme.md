In CSS (Cascading Style Sheets), selectors are used to target and apply styles to specific HTML elements. Here are some common CSS selectors and their representations:

1. `.` (Dot / Period):
   The dot represents a class selector in CSS. It is used to target HTML elements that have a specific class attribute assigned to them. Class selectors are denoted with a period (dot) followed by the class name.

   Example:
   ```css
   .highlight {
     background-color: yellow;
   }
   ```
   In this example, the class selector `.highlight` will target all elements with the class attribute set to "highlight" and apply a yellow background color.

2. `*` (Asterisk):
   The asterisk is known as the universal selector in CSS. It selects all HTML elements on the page, and you can apply styles to all elements using this selector.

   Example:
   ```css
   * {
     margin: 0;
     padding: 0;
   }
   ```
   In this example, the universal selector `*` will reset the margin and padding to zero for all elements on the page.

3. `#` (Hash / Pound):
   The hash symbol represents an ID selector in CSS. It is used to target a specific HTML element with a unique ID attribute. ID selectors are denoted with a hash symbol followed by the ID name.

   Example:
   ```css
   #header {
     font-size: 24px;
   }
   ```
   In this example, the ID selector `#header` will target the HTML element with the ID attribute set to "header" and apply a font size of 24 pixels.
  

   4. Element Selector:
      The element selector targets HTML elements based on their tag names. It selects all instances of a specific HTML tag.
   
      Example:
      ```css
      p {
        color: blue;
      }
      ```
      In this example, the element selector `p` will apply a blue color to all `<p>` elements on the page.
   
   5. Descendant Selector:
      The descendant selector targets elements that are descendants of another specified element. It is represented by a space between two selectors.
   
      Example:
      ```css
      div p {
        font-size: 16px;
      }
      ```
      In this example, the descendant selector `div p` will apply a font size of 16 pixels to all `<p>` elements that are descendants of a `<div>` element.
   
   6. Class Selector:
      The class selector targets HTML elements with a specific class attribute. It is represented by a dot followed by the class name.
   
      Example:
      ```css
      .highlight {
        background-color: yellow;
      }
      ```
      In this example, the class selector `.highlight` will apply a yellow background color to all elements with the class attribute set to "highlight."
   
   7. ID Selector:
      The ID selector targets a specific HTML element with a unique ID attribute. It is represented by a hash symbol followed by the ID name.
   
      Example:
      ```css
      #header {
        text-align: center;
      }
      ```
      In this example, the ID selector `#header` will center align the element with the ID attribute set to "header."
   
   5. Attribute Selector:
      The attribute selector targets HTML elements based on their attributes. It allows you to select elements with specific attribute values.
   
      Example:
      ```css
      input[type="text"] {
        border: 1px solid #ccc;
      }
      ```
      In this example, the attribute selector `input[type="text"]` will add a border to all `<input>` elements with the attribute `type` set to "text."
   
   8. Pseudo-class Selector:
      The pseudo-class selector targets elements based on their state or position. Pseudo-classes are preceded by a colon.
   
      Example:
      ```css
      a:hover {
        text-decoration: underline;
      }
      ```
      In this example, the pseudo-class selector `a:hover` will underline links when they are hovered over by the user.
